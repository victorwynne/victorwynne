Hayden Field, writing for The Verge:

>OpenAI has scrubbed mentions of io, the hardware startup co-founded by famous Apple designer Jony Ive, from its website and social media channels. The sudden change closely follows their recent announcement of [OpenAI’s nearly $6.5 billion acquisition](https://www.theverge.com/news/671838/openai-jony-ive-ai-hardware-apple) and plans to create dedicated AI hardware.
>
>OpenAI tells *The Verge* the deal is still happening, but it scrubbed mentions due to a trademark lawsuit from Iyo, the hearing device startup spun out of Google’s moonshot factory.

I guarantee this lawsuit ends very soon by way of a very large check being written.
