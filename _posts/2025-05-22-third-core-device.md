Tim Hardwick, writing for MacRumors:

>Details have leaked about the device that OpenAI is developing with former Apple designer Jony Ive. OpenAI is [acquiring](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/21/openai-buys-jony-ive-ai-startup/) io, the hardware-based AI startup co-created by Jony Ive, and the first product is one of a family of devices the company intends to launch.

>Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed details about the project in an internal staff call reviewed by [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/what-sam-altman-told-openai-about-the-secret-device-hes-making-with-jony-ive-f1384005). According to the report, the device isn’t a pair of glasses, given that Ive has been skeptical about building something you have to wear. It’s not a phone either, since Ive and Altman want to help wean people off of screens.

>Ive gave Altman a prototype of the first device to take home to test, said the OpenAI CEO. “I’ve been able to live with it, and I think it is the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen,” he said.

I truly believe we are seeing the 2025 version of the Jony and Steve design team that defined culture through futuristic design thirty years ago. Apple should be shitting its iPants.
