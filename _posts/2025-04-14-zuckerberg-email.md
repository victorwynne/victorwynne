Ashley Belanger, writing for Ars Technica:

>Starting the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) antitrust trial Monday with a bang, Daniel Matheson, the FTC’s lead litigator, flagged a “smoking gun”—a 2012 email where Mark Zuckerberg suggested that Facebook could buy Instagram to “neutralize a potential competitor,” The New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/technology/meta-antitrust-trial-ftc.html).
>
>And in “another banger of an email from Zuckerberg,” Brendan Benedict, an antitrust expert monitoring the trial for Big Tech on Trial, [posted](https://x.com/BBenedict33/status/1911799375904268464) on X that the Meta CEO wrote, “Messenger isn’t beating WhatsApp. Instagram was growing so much faster than us that we had to buy them for $1 billion... that’s not exactly killing it.”
>
>These messages and others, the FTC hopes to convince the court, provide evidence that Zuckerberg runs Meta by the mantra “it’s better to buy than compete”—seemingly for more than a decade intent on growing the Facebook empire by killing off rivals, allegedly in violation of antitrust law. Another message from Zuckerberg exhibited at trial, Benedict [noted](https://x.com/BBenedict33/status/1911792988847575043) on X, suggests Facebook tried to buy yet another rival, Snapchat, for $6 billion.
>
>“We should probably prepare for a leak that we offered $6b... and all the negative [attention] that will come from that,” the Zuckerberg message said.

This guy has been such a terrible person [in so many ways](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/03/22/meta-wynn-williams-book-zuckerberg-sandberg/) it is hard to even comprehend.
