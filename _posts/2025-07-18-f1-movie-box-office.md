I am sort of surprised this film has performed so well at the box office after a less than spectacular opening weekend. It was reported that Apple spent [north of $350 million](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/29/business/media/f1-the-movie-apple-box-office.html) getting it out the door. Seems like that [annoying push notification advertisement](https://victorwynne.com/wallet-app-ads/) in the Wallet app paid off for them.
