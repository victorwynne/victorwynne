description: Time released a 100 beat podcasts of all time list and I disagree with what is listed in almost every sense.

What exactly makes these the best podcasts of *all time*? I am guessing celebrity names being attached. I find many of them insufferable. My library contains 87 current shows, an additional 35 that no longer publish, but only 3 of them are on this *Time* list. Those being Conan, Pivot, and WTF. Most of the podcasts I listen to have been part of my weekly life more than a decade.
