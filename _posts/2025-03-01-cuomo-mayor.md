Katie Honan, writing for The City:

>Former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, who resigned in 2021 following a report that found he had sexually harassed multiple women, officially declared himself a candidate for mayor of New York City on Saturday, ending months of speculation about his potential candidacy.
>
>Cuomo released a 17-minute video declaring his candidacy on Saturday on his website, newly rebranded as [Cuomo for Mayor](https://www.andrewcuomo.com/).
