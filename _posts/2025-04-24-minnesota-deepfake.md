Miranda Nazzaro, writing for The Hill:

>Elon Musk’s social platform X filed a lawsuit Wednesday over a Minnesota law prohibiting the sharing of deepfakes to influence an election, alleging it violates free speech.
>
>In the complaint, [filed in federal court](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mnd.224575/gov.uscourts.mnd.224575.1.0_1.pdf) in Minnesota, X argues the law will “lead to blanket censorship, including of fully protected, core political speech.”
>
>[The law](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/2023/cite/609.771), passed in 2023, [defines a deepfake](https://www.sos.mn.gov/media/5626/deep-fake-overview.pdf) as videos, audio recordings or photos created with artificial intelligence (AI) tools to “realistically impersonate” a person without their permission or knowledge.
>
>Anyone who widely shares the deepfake within 90 days of an election could face criminal action.
>
>By threatening criminal action against social media platforms, X argues platforms are more likely to err on the side of removing content, even when it is a “close call” on whether it is a deepfake.

What an indefensible, but weirdly expected hill to die on.
