Mark Gurman, writing for Bloomberg:

>Apple Inc. will introduce a new homegrown app next week called Passwords, aiming to make it easier for customers to log in to websites and software, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

This is one of those *fucking finally* moments, a change that is long past due. If the [rumor of a Settings app overhaul](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169802/apple-wwdc-2024-ios-18-mac-os-15-settings-control-center-messages-mail-photos) is true then it makes sense this would be the time they pull these features out. Hopefully secure notes stored within the Passwords app comes along for the ride too.
