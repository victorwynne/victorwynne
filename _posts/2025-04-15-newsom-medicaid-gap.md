Trân Nguyễn, writing for the Associated Press:

>California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation Monday to close a $2.8 billion budget gap in the state’s Medicaid services and ensure coverage through June for 15 million people, including immigrants, who receive health care via the program.
>
>The legislation is part of the state’s solution to solve the [$6.2 billion](https://apnews.com/article/california-medicaid-funding-gap-billions-immigration-0ec8ca1663604d98d0437b92570ab8cb) hole in the state’s Medicaid budget. It comes a year after California launched [an ambitious coverage expansion](https://apnews.com/article/california-medicaid-expansion-undocumented-immigrants-34d8deb2186e9195b253f499e81a3d77) to provide free health care to all low-income adults regardless of their immigration status. The expansion is costing far more than the state projected and could force the Democratic governor and Democratic lawmakers to reevaluate future coverage for millions of people.

This is what Democrats doubling down on stupidity looks like.
