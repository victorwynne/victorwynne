>As far as I have been able to determine, this particular secret was undiscovered until now. People definitely knew the image was there in the ROM, but nobody had figured out how to actually activate it. This is probably one of the last easter eggs that existed in the Mac prior to [Steve Jobs reportedly banning them in 1997 when he returned to Apple](https://gizmodo.com/the-easter-eggs-are-back-in-os-x-and-this-one-is-insane-5929286). I wonder if he ever knew about this one?

This is so cool. I had no idea this image of the team even existed until now. I am sort of shocked to learn that Jobs banned engineers from adding easter eggs.
