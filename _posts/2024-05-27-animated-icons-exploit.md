Bryce Bostwick:

>iOS includes a feature called [Alternate App Icons](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring_your_app_to_use_alternate_app_icons) that allows apps to provide a set of multiple icon choices that the user can choose from. Apple includes a protection mechanism that prevents apps from changing their icons without user intervention, but Bryce [discovered a way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDVibKGtSVI) for this check to be bypassed. This allows apps to change their icons as frequently as they’d like — including fast enough to create the appearance of an animated icon.

I have a feeling this will be patched in short order.
