Ashley Belanger, writing for Ars Technica:

>Elon Musk is so opposed to Apple’s plan to integrate OpenAI’s ChatGPT with device operating systems that he’s seemingly spreading misconceptions while heavily criticizing the partnership.
>
>On X (formerly Twitter), Musk has been criticizing alleged privacy and security risks since the plan was announced Monday at Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference.
>
>“If Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies,” Musk posted on X. “That is an unacceptable security violation.” In another post responding to Apple CEO Tim Cook, Musk wrote, “Don’t want it. Either stop this creepy spyware or all Apple devices will be banned from the premises of my companies.”
>
>Musk also posted a meme suggesting that Apple planned to share user data with OpenAI. Another post of his temporarily received a fact-checking community note after suggesting that Apple hastily and cluelessly formed the partnership without regard for user privacy and security.
>
>“It’s patently absurd that Apple isn’t smart enough to make their own AI, yet is somehow capable of ensuring that OpenAI will protect your security & privacy!” Musk wrote. “Apple has no clue what’s actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI. They’re selling you down the river.”

Elon is just pissed that he is no longer part of the OpenAI party bus, and they inked a deal with one of the most trusted companies in the world. Just as with Trump, all the man knows how to do is manipulate reality, and make up the craziest damn lies that come to mind. If he were still partnered with Altman he would be singing the praises of this OS-level integration. His threatening Tim Cook by stating he will no longer allow his employees to use Apple products will only piss off one group of people, his employees.
