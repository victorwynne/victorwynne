Wes Davis, writing for The Verge:

>Crosswalk buttons in at least three California cities appear to have been hacked this weekend to give them the seemingly AI-generated voices of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In videos posted online, the apparent voice of Musk begs listeners to be his friend, or that of Zuckerberg brags about “undermining democracy” and “cooking our grandparents’ brains with AI slop.”

>A Palo Alto, California city spokesperson [told Palo Alto Online](https://www.paloaltoonline.com/technology/2025/04/12/silicon-valley-crosswalk-buttons-apparently-hacked-to-imitate-musk-zuckerberg-voices/) that city employees “determined that 12 downtown intersections were impacted,” and have disabled the crosswalks’ voice features pending repairs. The signals otherwise work as they should, they told the outlet. The hack seemed to have taken place on Friday, the person said.

>The same thing is happening in Redwood City, where a deputy city manager [told The San Francisco Chronicle](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/zuckerberg-musk-crosswalk-recordings-20273686.php) that the city is investigating and attempting to resolve the issue there. Crosswalk buttons in Menlo Park are also reportedly affected.

Poignant, yet comedic gold.
