When Apple first jumped into live sports streaming just three years ago, it looked like the company was ready to play in the big leagues. Apple and MLB signed a seven-year deal worth roughly $85 million before the 2022 season, bringing Friday Night Baseball exclusively to Apple TV+. The move felt bold and strategic, positioning the tech giant as a serious player in the sports media landscape alongside traditional broadcasters and newer streaming rivals.

Fast-forward to this past week, and the story has taken a different turn. Apple is ending its three-year “Friday Night Baseball” partnership with MLB after the 2025 season, with insiders citing low viewership, high costs, and fan frustration with fragmented streaming access. The decision marks a notable retreat from what once seemed like an aggressive push into live sports content.

This news comes with added context that makes it even more interesting. Reports surfaced recently that Apple had been eyeing MLB Saturday games, suggesting the company was considering expanding rather than retreating from baseball. Instead, Apple is reported to be ‘fully out’ of MLB rights deals, with NBC likely stepping in to fill the void left behind.

The timing raises questions about whether Apple’s broader sports strategy is working as planned. The company made headlines with its massive commitment to Major League Soccer, signing a ten-year deal reportedly worth billions. They’ve also been linked to potential Formula 1 streaming rights in the United States. Yet the baseball retreat suggests that throwing money at sports content doesn’t automatically translate to success.

Sports streaming is notoriously expensive, and the returns can be unpredictable. With sports rights costs approaching $3.75 billion annually, Apple opened the door for a business where revenue might easily fail to match those costs. Unlike scripted television shows or documentaries, live sports require ongoing, hefty payments to leagues and organizations, with no guarantee that audiences will follow.

The challenge becomes even more complex when considering how fans actually consume sports content. Baseball, in particular, has deep regional loyalties, with many fans preferring their local broadcast teams and familiar viewing habits. Moving games to a streaming platform that requires a separate subscription creates barriers that traditional broadcasters don’t face.

Apple’s approach to sports has always felt somewhat experimental. The company has deep pockets and can afford to test different strategies, but even tech giants need to see reasonable returns on their investments. Apple is spending more than $3 billion a year on content to bolster the Apple TV+ library to try and attract more subscribers, and sports rights represent a significant chunk of that budget.

The financial reality makes these decisions even more pressing. Apple TV+ operates at a substantial loss, with the streaming service generating far less revenue than the company spends on content and operations. While Apple can absorb these losses as part of a broader ecosystem strategy, the pressure to show progress becomes more intense when individual content deals fail to deliver expected audiences. Every expensive sports contract that doesn’t move the subscriber needle makes it harder to justify the overall streaming investment to shareholders and internal stakeholders.

The broader streaming landscape adds another layer of complexity. Every major tech company seems to want a piece of live sports, driving up prices and creating a fragmented viewing experience for fans. Amazon grabbed Thursday Night Football, Netflix is exploring live events, and traditional broadcasters are fighting to hold onto their most valuable content.

What makes Apple’s situation particularly noteworthy is how the company typically approaches new markets. They usually enter with a clear strategy, substantial resources, and a long-term commitment. The quick pivot away from MLB suggests that sports streaming might be more challenging than anticipated, even for a company with Apple’s resources and expertise.

Looking ahead, it’s worth watching whether this signals a broader shift in Apple’s content strategy. The company could double down on the sports properties that are working, like MLS, while backing away from those that aren’t delivering expected results. Alternatively, this could be the beginning of a more cautious approach to live sports altogether.

The baseball experiment provided valuable lessons, even if it didn’t work out as planned. Sports fans are particular about how and where they watch games, and building new viewing habits takes time and patience. Sometimes the cost of that patience exceeds what even the biggest companies are willing to pay.

For now, Friday Night Baseball will continue through the 2025 season before moving to its new home. Apple will likely take what it learned from this experience and apply it to future content decisions. Whether that means refining their sports strategy or stepping back from live events entirely remains to be seen. Either way, the decision sends a clear message about the realities of competing in the expensive and complicated world of sports media rights.
