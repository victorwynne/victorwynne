I held off on commenting about [Liquid Glass](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/219) until I had a few days using the beta to experience it first hand. It seems like this is a controversial opinion, but I really like it. It brings renewed life and vibrancy to the interface. I would bet it gets rethought and tweaked a bit over the course of the summer, and it definitely needs to be.

My biggest quibble so far is the lack of readability when it comes to the new tab bar design, and the need for less transparency in Control Center. The clear app icons have the potential to look great, but it is highly dependent on the wallpaper being used. Overall I am a fan, and just as iOS 7 was dialed up over time, this design needs to be dialed down to hit a sweet spot.
