Stephen Nellis, writing for Reuters:

>Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Tuesday signed into law a bill requiring Apple and Alphabetâ€™s Google to verify the age of users of their app stores, putting the second-most-populous U.S. state at the center of a debate over whether and how to regulate smartphone use by children and teenagers.
>
>The law, effective on January 1, requires parental consent to download apps or make in-app purchases for users aged below 18. Utah was the first U.S. state to pass a similar law earlier this year, and U.S. lawmakers have also introduced a federal bill.

I wish the federal government would enact this instead of individual states doing so, but regardless this has been a long time coming.
