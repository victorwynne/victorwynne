>It’s unclear when the new program would be rolled out or what the vetting process will involve, but the initiative would replace the EB-5 immigrant investor visa program, which allows people who invest enough into the US to apply for permanent residency. The new offering would [instead require a direct payment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-25/trump-to-launch-gold-card-visa-program-for-wealthy-investors) to the federal government.

Want to come here to chase the American dream, aspire to build a better life for yourself? Nah, “fuck you”, apparently.
