Since the antisemite won the primary election yesterday, I thought it even more important to link to this piece from the editors of National Review.

>Mamdani has stated repeatedly — including during a recent mayoral [debate](https://nypost.com/2025/06/04/us-news/zohran-mamdani-still-wont-answer-if-israel-has-a-right-to-exists-jewish-state-and-faces-quick-backlash-from-andrew-cuomo-during-debate/), when pressed directly on the issue by both Cuomo and the moderator — that he does not believe Israel has a right to exist as a Jewish state. Invoking (by now) familiar code language, he instead argues that Israel can only exist “as a state with equal rights” — that is to say, the “right of return.” A week ago, in an interview, Mamdani refused to condemn use of the phrase “globalize the intifada” — universally understood as a call to bring Hamas’s particular tactics of “resistance” to the Western world — and doubled down by favorably comparing the term to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.

>These are not fashionable or late-adopted positions for Mamdani. While in college at Bowdoin, he co-founded his school’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine. For years (including during his brief tenure as an assemblyman), Mamdani has been a vocal supporter of the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement designed to academically and intellectually isolate Israelis and Zionist Jews from Western scientific discourse. He has repeatedly and emphatically called Israel’s war in Gaza a “genocide.” In 2017, he recorded a rap song sending his “love” to the “Holy Land Five” — leaders of the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development convicted in 2008 of providing “material support for terrorism” to Hamas. Perhaps most tellingly of all, when news of the October 7 massacre first arrived, Mamdani issued a [statement](https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1711093032907321525) saying nothing about Hamas; he instead called for “ending the occupation and dismantling apartheid.”

Fuck this guy. My vote in November will be directed to whoever has the best chance of beating him in the general election.
