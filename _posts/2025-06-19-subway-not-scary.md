Hamilton Nolan, writing on his Substack:

>Subway’s not scary. It’s fine and safe. It’s full of women and children. There are tons of old ladies on there. You should def be helping those old ladies carry their grocery carts up the stairs. That is an issue we can discuss. The rest of the stuff, I don’t know what you’re talking about.

This New York City transplant who probably works from home, and has never taken the train above 86th Street is so full of crap. Not only is the article just an underhanded way of further endorsing Mamdani for mayor, but it also could not be [more terribly timed](https://abc7ny.com/amp/post/nyc-subway-crime-2-people-stabbed-grand-central-42-street-station-police-say/16780850/). Screw Kottke, who doesn’t live here, for [linking to this trash](https://kottke.org/25/06/0046974-the-nyc-subway-is-not).
