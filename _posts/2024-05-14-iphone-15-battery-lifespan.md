Chance Miller writing for 9to5Mac:

>Apple initially said that the iPhone 15â€™s battery would retain up to 80% of its original capacity at 500 complete charge cycles. Now, the company tells *9to5Mac* that the iPhone 15 can retain 80% of its original capacity at 1000 complete charge cycles.

When this was originally reported on back in February I didn't necessarily take such a drastic claim seriously. Sure, maybe there were improvements made, but *double* the lifespan? Now that I have been using an iPhone 15 Pro for ~8 months I definitely do believe it. With just under 300 battery cycles the device has retained 98% of its maximum capacity, and states peak performance battery health. I would be thrilled to see Mac laptops receive the same treatment.
