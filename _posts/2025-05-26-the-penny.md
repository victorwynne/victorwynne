Jennifer Mattson, writing for Fast Company:

>Like many things these days, it turns out the cost of making a penny is a lot more expensive than it used to be—over 20% more in 2024, to be precise, according to the Treasury. Blame it on higher costs of production and materials, but either way, the U.S. lost more than $85 million making the penny last year, per [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/finance/penny-coin-mint-ending-2026-b1717de0). Halting production is expected to save taxpayers $56 million annually.

Honestly, what the hell took so long?…but it gets even more annoying:

>However, a look at the numbers also shows that nickels cost even more money to produce [at 13.8 cents](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/10/business/cost-to-make-penny-nickel-dg/index.html) each, or 11 cents for production costs plus 2.8 cents for administrative and distribution, based on the most recent fiscal year, per [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/22/business/us-discontinue-penny).

Soon it won’t matter because paper currency is going the way of the fax machine. Still in existence? Sure, but whenever someone suggests you use it there is a moment of shock and disdain.
