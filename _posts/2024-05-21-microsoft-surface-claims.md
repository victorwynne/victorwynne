Andrew Cunningham writing for Ars Technica:

>One caveat that I hadn't seen mentioned in Microsoft's presentation or in other coverage of the announcement, though â€” Microsoft says that both of these devices have fans. Apple still uses fans for the MacBook Pro lineup, but the MacBook Air is totally fanless. Bear that in mind when reading Microsoft's claims about performance.

So another way of interpreting the Surface announcement would be, "we aren't able to match the performance (not to mention performance per-watt) of the MacBook Pro."
