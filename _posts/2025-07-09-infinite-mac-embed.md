I first wrote about Infinite Mac [back in 2022](https://victorwynne.com/infinite-mac/) and a neat recent update now allows you to use HTML embeds to add them to your own website.

>You can now [embed](https://infinitemac.org/embed) any OS from [Infinite Mac](https://infinitemac.org/) into your website, from 1984’s System 1.0 through 2005’s Mac OS X 10.4. There’s [documentation](https://infinitemac.org/embed-docs) for customizing and controlling embedded instances programmatically. As a demo of what’s possible, [Infinite Monkey](https://infinitemac.org/monkey/) hooks up an emulated Mac 128K to [OpenAI’s](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-computer-use) and [Anthropic’s](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/computer-use-tool) computer-using models, letting the technologies of 1984 and 2025 to finally meet. The instigator behind all this was [Marcin Wichary](https://aresluna.org/), whose recent [Frame of preference](https://aresluna.org/frame-of-preference/) article is another showcase of the embedding capabilities.
