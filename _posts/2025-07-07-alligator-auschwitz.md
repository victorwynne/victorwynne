Andrea Pitzer, author of *One Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps*:

>For many Americans, the word “concentration camp” evokes another country, a time long ago and a facility operating in the dark of night, away from the prying eyes of an outraged public. But a new concentration camp opened in Florida’s Everglades this week, and it’s the opposite of a secret.

>President Donald Trump [toured the facility](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-alligator-alcatraz-detention-center-florida/) with reporters in tow. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other officials posed with him, laughing in front of cages meant for human beings. The Florida Republican Party [launched merchandise](https://www.fastcompany.com/91362081/alligator-alcatraz-merch-shirts-hats-amazon-florida-gop-detention-center) and gave the camp a nickname, “Alligator Alcatraz,” that [the state made official](https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida/2025/07/01/alligator-alcatraz-is-no-nickname-its-detention-camps-official-name/).

>But it’s not just a new prison, Alcatraz or otherwise. I visited four continents to write a [global history of concentration camps](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/andrea-pitzer/one-long-night/). This facility’s purpose fits the classic model: mass civilian detention [without real trials](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article309792865.html) targeting vulnerable groups for political gain based on ethnicity, race, religion or political affiliation [rather than for crimes committed](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-detentions-non-criminal-immigrants-violent-crime-convictions-analysis/). And its existence points to serious dangers ahead for the country.

The number of people applauding this online, and proud to show off the merch they’ve bought is absolutely disgusting.
