Elizabeth Lopatto, writing for The Verge:

>[Donald Trump and Elon Musk, two of the most media-addled personalities of our time](https://www.theverge.com/politics/631078/trump-musk-doge-tesla-internet-tv-politics-spectacle), are publicly torching their relationship by posting on the public social media networks they each respectively own. I have seen theories that this is kayfabe, and I don’t buy it. Trump and Musk have publicly shit-talked people, including each other, before turning around and working with them. But this is real; threats are being made.
