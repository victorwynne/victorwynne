Tim Hardwick, writing for *MacRumors*:

>Weibo-based leaker [Instant Digital](https://t.co/nBP4VF7qri) on Thursday hinted that the iPhone 17 Pro has a “special” color variant that is said to be “connected to the iOS 26 Liquid Glass design.”
>
>The leaker, who only claims to have heard of it but not seen it, seems to believe that the color is what previous leaks have simply referred to as white, “but it appears differently depending on the lighting.”
>
>While speculative, a white base material that subtly shifts hues depending on light and angle could add a dynamic, refractive quality to the color. Combined with the Liquid Glass UI aesthetic of iOS 26, a shimmering surface could potentially create a sense of motion or unity with the glassy elements of the software interface.

Hearing about this potential casing color makes me wonder if the rumored [all glass iPhone](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/08/ios-26-liquid-glass-20th-anniversary-iphone/) is really just a misunderstanding. Making an iPhone entirely of glass seems…fragile.
