Eric Boehm, writing for *Reason*:

>The Trump administration’s 50 percent tariffs on imported steel and aluminum were expanded this week to cover hundreds of imports that plainly are not steel or aluminum. Among the items targeted by the new tariffs: dairy products like milk and cream, as well as gasoline and other fuels, fire extinguishers, baby strollers, furniture, engines, and motorcycles. In short, anything that contains steel or aluminum or that is (as with dairy products) transported or stored in steel or aluminum containers could now be subject to those massive import taxes.

Did someone order stupidity with a side of unilateral power? The details really drive home how unprecedented this is:

>Officially, the Commerce Department [says](https://media.bis.gov/press-release/department-commerce-adds-407-product-categories-steel-aluminum-tariffs) the [407 new product categories](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/08/19/2025-15819/adoption-and-procedures-of-the-section-232-steel-and-aluminum-tariff-inclusions-process) covered by the tariffs are “derivative” of steel and aluminum. Only the steel and aluminum components of the imports will actually be taxed.

>In reality, however, this is a wild expansion of how tariffs typically apply.

>“Many of these new [Harmonized Tariff Schedule] HTS provisions would not normally be considered aluminum or steel derivative products,” [notes](https://www.anderinger.com/trump-administration-adds-407-additional-hts-provisions-section-232-aluminum-steel-tariffs/) Michael Roll, a trade attorney for Deringer, an international logistics firm, “at least not by any reasonable understanding of those words.”

I think it is clear by now that the term “reasonable understanding” is completely foreign to every part of this administration.
