Acting President Claire Shipman:

>Columbia University has reached an [agreement](https://president.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/July%202025%20Announcement/Columbia%20University%20Resolution%20Agreement.pdf) with the United States Government to resolve multiple federal agency investigations into alleged violations of federal anti-discrimination laws. As part of the resolution, Columbia will pay a $200 million settlement over three years to the federal government. In addition, the University has agreed to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for $21 million. Importantly, the agreement preserves Columbia’s autonomy and authority over faculty hiring, admissions, and academic decision-making.

>Under today’s agreement, a vast majority of the federal grants which were terminated or paused in March 2025 will be reinstated, and Columbia’s access to billions of dollars in current and future grants will be restored. This includes the reinstatement of the majority of grants previously terminated by the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Health and Human Services, renewal of non-competitive grants, the release of overdue payments on active, non-terminated grants, and Columbia’s restored eligibility to apply for new federal research funding in the ordinary course. The portion of funding not restored reflects broader reductions by the government in certain research areas and is not related to the conduct addressed in this agreement.

This capitulation by Columbia University to the Trump administration is a deeply disappointing and short-sighted maneuver that sacrifices academic freedom for financial expediency. Paying a massive settlement and agreeing to external monitoring will not deter future political interference; instead, it sets a dangerous precedent, emboldening those who seek to dictate campus discourse and suppress dissent. This agreement, rather than fostering a truly inclusive environment, merely appeases external pressures and paves the way for continued attacks on the autonomy that defines institutions of higher learning.
