All this recent [OpenAI discourse](https://mashable.com/article/altman-openai-scarlett-johansson) reminded me of the time Vanna White sued Samsung for replicating her likeness using a robot on a Wheel of Fortune–style set in one of their commercials.

The [results](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_v._Samsung_Electronics_America,_Inc.):

>The United States District Court for the Southern District of California granted summary judgment against White on all counts, and White appealed.
>
>The Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court, finding that White had a cause of action based on the value of her image, and that Samsung had appropriated this image. Samsung’s assertion that this was a parody was found to be unavailing, as the intent of the ad was not to make fun of White’s characteristics, but to sell VCRs.

Tying this to OpenAI’s use of a voice so similar to Scarlett Johansson‘s, the fact that it is being used in a commercial product to make it attractive to consumers, that is what makes *her* case against OpenAI so strong.
