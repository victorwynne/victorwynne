From the bitchat GitHub repository:

>A secure, decentralized, peer-to-peer messaging app that works over Bluetooth mesh networks. No internet required, no servers, no phone numbers - just pure encrypted communication.

How can you argue with him when the name is all lowercase, and the word decentralized is thrown in? Reading that immediately brought to mind a toy I used to chat with classmates when I was in elementary school called Friend Link.

This [nostalgic Reddit user](https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/s/61mjDZ26lQ) explains it as succinctly as Dorsey does with bitchat:

>It was like a toy beeper. You could send text messages to friends who also had a Friend.link, so long as they were within 25 ft. of you lol
>
>I found the commercial for it on YouTube
