James Felton writing for IFLScience:

>After a successful launch on January 8, the world has been watching the first-ever private US mission to land on the Moon, especially as it got into trouble not long after lift-off. Unfortunately, it's looking pretty certain that NASA's equipment for searching for water ice and examining the lunar soil, as well as several other payloads from seven different countries, will not make it to the Moon. At least, not softly.

>The spaceship hit trouble shortly after heading out of the Earth's atmosphere, leaving it unable to point its solar panels at the Sun. Astrobotic has now confirmed that there is "no chance" of a soft landing on the Moon.

Those three presidential hair strands just floating around in space lol.
