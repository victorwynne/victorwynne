Kevin J. Elliott, writing for Liberal Currents:

>The place to look for fascism is in the politics and program of a political movement; it’s about how they talk and what they aim to do rather than in the structure of power. Of course, they want the authoritarian structure of executive-focused unchecked power and seek to build it where it’s lacking. But this is in service of the core fascist mission: a cultural rebirth in which the nation, understood as its (racially) pure or ‘true’ people, is saved from destruction and its enemies are purged from within.
>
>Thus, all forms of fascism are authoritarian, but not all authoritarianisms are fascist. Authoritarianism encompasses many non-fascist regimes. Recognizing the fascism of Trump II requires disaggregating these two projects.

Jamelle Bouie [identifies](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/opinion/trump-dei-meritocracy-civil-right.html) this latter part of the agenda as a concerted effort to impose resegregation, revealing the unique Americanness of this Trumpian variant of fascism.

This piece does a great job of breaking down the many facets to Trump’s attempt at destroying democratic norms. A must read.
