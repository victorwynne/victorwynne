>Website traffic is overwhelmingly dominated now by “bots” executing sophisticated cyberattacks and sucking up every scrap of content; only a tiny fraction of our traffic comes from legitimate human visitors. Unfortunately, these rampant and rising abuses and attacks drive rising server costs, and there’s no practical way to stop them — they originate from networks at Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, Tencent, Russia, hosting companies, proxies, and limitless other networks everywhere in the world.

>I personally need to stop and take a break for a while to re-assess priorities and approaches going forward. I’m putting macintouch.com on pause in an attempt to stem the rising costs, but I’ll note that [tidbits.com](https://tidbits.com/) offers an alternative with similar history and values, and I hope to provide occasional [updates](https://www.macintouch.com/updates.html).

He can sugar coat it with the vague hope of future updates, but the writing is on the wall. MacInTouch began as a print journal in 1985, and the website launched in 1994. It has been a resource I turn to since I first began using the Mac in 2002.
