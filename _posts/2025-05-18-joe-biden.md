Jack Dunn, writing for Variety:

>“Last week, President Joe Biden was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms,” read the statement. “On Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone.”
>
>A Gleason Score is a scale used to determine how likely cancer cells located in the prostate will spread or grow, according to Mount Sinai. The scale is graded from three to 10, so Biden’s nine means his cancer cells are more likely to advance than most.
>
>The statement added that Biden’s diagnosis “represents a more aggressive form” of cancer, but that his case was “hormone-sensitive,” which should make treatment easier.

No matter what your politics are, this is terribly sad news. The man committed decades of his life to public service. Sad to consider him not being able to enjoy several more decades in well deserved retirement.
