Nate Anderson, writing for *Ars Technica*:

>In a [300-plus page final report](https://media.defense.gov/2025/Aug/05/2003773004/-1/-1/0/SUBMERSIBLE%20TITAN%20MBI%20REPORT%20(04AUG2025).PDF) released today, the US Coast Guard analyzed the 2023 *Titan* sub implosion from every conceivable angle and came to a clear conclusion: OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush was a dangerous and deeply unpleasant boss.
>
>His company used “intimidation tactics” to sidestep regulatory scrutiny, it was a “toxic” workplace, and its safety culture was “critically flawed.” The *Titan* itself was “undocumented, unregistered, non-certificated, [and] unclassed.” As for Rush, he managed to “completely ignore vital inspections, data analyses, and preventative maintenance procedures.” The result was a “catastrophic event” that occurred when 4,930 pounds per square inch of water pressure cracked the sub open and crushed its five occupants during a dive to the *Titanic* wreckage site.
>
>Had Rush somehow survived, the report says, he would have been referred for prosecution.

I could not agree more with this summation. If you haven’t already, check out the [HBO Max documentary](https://www.hbomax.com/movies/implosion-the-titanic-sub-disaster/6fb172ef-8a64-4cc5-a489-32e7df7a1c4e) detailing just how grossly negligent this guy was.
