>The Tesla Diner lets people grab comfort food like burgers and fries (served in [boxes shaped like Cybertrucks](https://x.com/whistingbhole/status/1946729843485508000)) and milkshakes while charging their vehicles. The Diner has giant screens so people can watch things [like movie clips](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1378063008795041795) while charging their cars, though watching from the screens in your Tesla [is apparently an option, too](https://x.com/whistingbhole/status/1946726709484474575). One of Tesla’s Optimus robots was even spotted [serving popcorn](https://x.com/whistingbhole/status/1946997096219107475) at a recent soft launch event.

Obviously for a multitude of reasons I am firmly in the ‘screw Musk and Tesla’ camp, but I have to admit that the Cybertruck burger boxes are freaking adorable.
