Alana Wise, writing for NPR:

>Political commentator and television host Joy Reid has been fired from her position at MSNBC, where she anchors her show *The ReidOut*. The move comes as the network is restructuring its programming.
>
>“Joy Reid is leaving the network and we thank her for her countless contributions over the years,” MSNBC president Rebecca Kutler said in a memo to staff. Reid’s final show was on Monday.
>
>…
>
>In a recorded Zoom interview with the organization Win With Black Women on Monday, Reid broke down in tears, describing the anger and disappointment she felt at losing her job.
>
>“But in the end, where I really land, and where I’ve landed on today is just gratitude,” Reid said, wiping away tears. “Not just because people would take the time to get on a call like this or to take care of me. But also that my show had value.”

She can take her tears and fuck right off. I’m happy to see her fired because I’ve despised the woman since it came to light in 2018 that she is a homophobic bigot.

Quoting from [original reporting](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/4/27/17286392/joy-reid-msnbc-lgbtq-gay-hack) by German Lopez, writing for Vox:

>Joy-Ann Reid on Saturday apologized for her past “hurtful” remarks about LGBTQ people, following the resurfacing of homophobic blog posts from the mid-to-late 2000s. But she also said that she still doesn’t “believe” that she wrote the blog posts, suggesting — without evidence — that they were the result of an elaborate hack.

Yeah, sure Joy. Let’s see how much water that idea holds:

>Instead of apologizing for the more recently resurfaced blog posts, though, Reid at first denied that she posted them altogether. In a [statement to Mediaite](https://www.mediaite.com/online/exclusive-joy-reid-claims-newly-discovered-homophobic-posts-from-her-blog-were-fabricated/) on Monday, Reid said that the blog posts were the work of hackers and “part of an effort to taint my character with false information by distorting a blog that ended a decade ago.”
>
>There was always reason to be skeptical of the claim. For one, the blog posts were archived by internet crawlers and, in those archives, really dated to the mid-to-late 2000s — a time when Reid wasn’t an MSNBC host or even a widely known national figure, raising questions about why someone would bother hacking her. This helped elevate the controversy further, as even some of Reid’s supporters questioned why she didn’t apologize instead of making assertions that have no evidence behind them and that many find literally unbelievable.
>
>Reid herself acknowledged the skepticism on her show on Saturday: “When a friend found [the posts] in December and sent them to me, I was stunned. Frankly, I couldn’t imagine where they’d come from or whose voice that was. In the months since, I’ve spent a lot of time trying to make sense of these posts. I hired cybersecurity experts to see if somebody had manipulated my words or my former blog. And the reality is they have not been able to prove it.”

It’s pretty hard to prove what doesn’t exist. The internet archive doesn’t lie. Her supposedly “hacked” blog combined with homophobic tweets in the past combine to show how truly shitty this person really is. I am overjoyed (no pun intended 🤭) to see her gone from network television, and look forward to being completely void of her presence going forward.
