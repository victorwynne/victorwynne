>The Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) has held strong in Windows for nearly 40 years, but that’s about to change. Microsoft revealed earlier this year that it was [overhauling its BSOD error](https://www.theverge.com/news/639445/microsoft-windows-bsod-black-new-design) message in Windows 11, and the company has now confirmed that it will soon be known as the Black Screen of Death. The new design drops the traditional blue color, frowning face, and QR code in favor of a simplified black screen.

The funniest part about this is the acronym staying the same. To another 40 years! 🖤💀🍻
