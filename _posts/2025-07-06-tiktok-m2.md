description: A new U.S. specific TikTok app could replace the old one in September.

Richard Lawler, writing for The Verge:

>TikTok’s staff is reportedly working on a new version of the app — dubbed M2, to the current app’s internal M designation — for release in app stores on September 5th. Trump issued a third [legally questionable](https://www.theverge.com/tiktok/697982/trump-tiktok-ban-apple-google-letters-pam-bondi) extension of the deadline to ban TikTok from US app stores [last month](https://www.theverge.com/news/688252/tiktok-ban-trump-extension-deal), which is set to expire in mid-September.

A lot of unknowns here, but the biggest question I have is whether it will interface with content being posted to the current TikTok app, or be completely independent. If it operates exclusively for U.S. users then it will not have a comparable impact on reach like we’ve seen up until now.
