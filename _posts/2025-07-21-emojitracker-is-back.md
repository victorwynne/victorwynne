>Today, as part of this year’s [World Emoji Day](https://emojipedia.org/world-emoji-day?ref=blog.emojipedia.org) celebrations, Emojipedia is pleased to announce the long-anticipated relaunch of the real-time emoji analysis site [EmojiTracker.com](https://emojitracker.com/?ref=blog.emojipedia.org). Now powered by Emojipedia’s global user base, the site supports all emojis approved since 2010 and also features a selection of new country-specific filters.

>…
>
>In June 2021, it was [announced](https://blog.emojipedia.org/emojipedia-emojitracker/) that Emojipedia had acquired the [EmojiTracker](https://emojitracker.com/?ref=blog.emojipedia.org) to oversee its upkeep and aim to update its support for emojis beyond the 842 from [Unicode 6.0](https://emojipedia.org/unicode-6.0/?ref=blog.emojipedia.org).
>
>While this update work was underway, Twitter was acquired by Elon Musk, rebranded as X, and, soon after, new limitations were placed on accessing the API data that [EmojiTracker](https://emojitracker.com/?ref=blog.emojipedia.org) had been powered by.

>*Editor’s Note: courtesy of our own [David Doochin](https://blog.emojipedia.org/author/david-doochin/), you can read more about how these changes within Twitter changed the history of not just the Emojitracker but also the Twemoji emoji set [here](https://blog.emojipedia.org/a-timeline-of-twemoji-world-emoji-day-2025/).*
>
>Therefore, since early 2023, the previously animated site has been still. Yet today it now returns, with support for all 3,790 emojis approved by [Unicode](https://emojipedia.org/the-unicode-consortium?ref=blog.emojipedia.org) since [Unicode 6.0](https://emojipedia.org/unicode-6.0/?ref=blog.emojipedia.org) in 2010.
