Originally reported by Camilla Hodgson and Stephen Morris, of the Financial Times:

>Google’s greenhouse gas emissions have surged 48 percent in the past five years due to the expansion of its data centers that underpin artificial intelligence systems, leaving its commitment to get to “net zero” by 2030 in doubt.
>
>The Silicon Valley company’s pollution amounted to 14.3 million tonnes of carbon equivalent in 2023, a 48 percent increase from its 2019 baseline and a 13 percent rise since last year, Google said in its annual environmental report on Tuesday.

Apple’s foray into AI features mostly being processed on-device keeps making more sense as time goes on.
