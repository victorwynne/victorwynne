>But with the upcoming change, that system is expanding to also cover what Apple calls consumables, non-consumables, and non-renewing subscriptions. In practice, this means mobile games could start handing out codes for free gems or extra lives at a live event, or an indie productivity app could email users a one-time code for discounted unlocks.

To call this feature long-overdue is a huge understatement. So glad to finally see this policy change.
