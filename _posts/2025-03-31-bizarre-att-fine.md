Ben Lovejoy, writing for 9to5Mac:

>Apple has been fined $162M by France’s competition regulator for the way App Tracking Transparency is implemented, stating that this is an abuse of the company’s powers.
This bizarre ruling follows a complaint by a group of trade associations representing advertisers who are no longer able to access user data to serve personalized ads.

I am truly shocked by this. It could not be more obvious that a lobbyist for this trade association lined the pockets of French regulators. A true smack in the face to a company that holds user privacy in such high regard.
