>A month of anti-Tesla dissent escalated this week with two reports of Teslas catching fire in Las Vegas and Kansas City.

The first incident happened early Tuesday morning at a Tesla collision center in Las Vegas, where police say a suspect in all-black gear hit several vehicles with Molotov cocktails and three bullets and painted the word “resist” on the doors of the facility, reports [Las Vegas Review-Journal](https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/several-vehicle-set-on-fire-at-tesla-in-las-vegas-police-say-3322726/).

>In Kansas City, Police Captain Jacob Becchina said in a statement that an officer first observed smoke coming from a Cybertruck parked in a Tesla parking lot. “The officer used his fire extinguisher, however KCFD was still needed as he could not put the fire out,” Becchina said. “The fire spread to a second Cybertruck parked next to the original burning one. The circumstances are under investigation but preliminarily the fire is being investigated for the potential of being an Arson.”
