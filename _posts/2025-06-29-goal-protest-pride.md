>The Gay Officers Action League (GOAL) – an organization of LGBTQIA+ New York City Police Department officers – plans to protest [Sunday’s NYC Pride March](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/nyc-pride-march-2025/) over a disagreement about officers marching in full uniform.

>GOAL wants to participate in the March while wearing their full police uniforms, which means carrying concealed firearms.

>Heritage of Pride, the nonprofit that organizes NYC Pride, says that goes against the weapon policy for the Pride March and offered a compromise – letting GOAL march in uniform but without carrying their service weapons.

I understand the public safety issue that comes with police in uniform not being armed, but definitely siding with the organizers on this one. After all, the marches began in response to [persecution by NYC police](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots). These gay officers have to pick a lane, and protesting the event is certainly the wrong one.
