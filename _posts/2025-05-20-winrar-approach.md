Basic Apple Guy:

>I thought long and hard about whether or not I should include exclusive wallpapers behind this paywall but ultimately decided against it. I want anyone who visits my site to have access to everything, even though I believe it could improve sales to offer exclusive works.
>
>So what I’m introducing to the site is something I’m calling the WinRAR approach. If you’re familiar with WinRAR, the Windows file compression tool, you’ll know where this is going. WinRAR became infamous for offering a “30-day trial” that never actually expired. Instead of cutting off access or locking features, it simply asked users to consider purchasing it if they found it useful. It ran on goodwill, and that model worked.
>
>That’s the spirit behind the WirRAR approach. Everything I share remains free and fully accessible, but if you’ve found value in my work and want to support it, there’s an easy way to do so. No pressure, just appreciation.

I honestly can’t remember the last time my iPhone wallpaper was anything besides one of his designs. The gradients are [my favorite](https://basicappleguy.com/haberdashery/novawallpaper), and I’m always looking forward to new releases. I will definitely be supporting such fantastic work moving forward.
