>President Donald Trump addressed the nation Saturday evening after the U.S. military executed airstrikes against three sites in Iran with nuclear enrichment facilities amid rising geopolitical conflict over Iran’s nuclear program.
>
>“Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success. Iran’s key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated,” Trump said in a speech from a podium at the White House. “It’s Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace. If they do not, future attacks will be far greater and a lot easier.”

This is not going to *stop* Iran from creating nuclear weapons, just delay the process. Not surprisingly, Trump once again broke with democratic norms by not seeking congressional approval before conducting these airstrikes.
