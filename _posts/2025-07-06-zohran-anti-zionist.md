From the Times of Israel:

>Zohran’s platform reflects the Jewish call for justice and also offers a clear plan to address antisemitic violence.
>
>For many of us, the campaigns of Mamdani and mensch co-endorser Brad Lander marked the first time in a long while that we witnessed the Jewish call for justice clearly reflected in the platforms and character of mayoral candidates. We are confident that Zohran will carry those values forward – we hope, all the way to Gracie Mansion.

Apparently Mamdani’s plan to address antisemitic violence is by refusing to condemn use of the phrase “globalize the intifada”, and stating repeatedly in a televised debate that Israel does not have the right to exist. It is beyond disgusting that the Times of *Israel* would publish this endorsement written by a group of anti-Zionist and extreme left-wing Rabbis.
