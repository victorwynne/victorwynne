Excerpt from the press release:

>While customers can easily switch using their current phone, Trump Mobile is also excited to announce it will release the “T1 Phone” in August. It is a sleek, gold smartphone engineered for performance and proudly designed and built in the United States for customers who expect the best from their mobile carrier.

This isn’t a mobile carrier, it’s a white label reseller of the actual carriers. Also, this is so rich in hypocrisy. Apple is being threatened with huge tariffs for not manufacturing the iPhone in America, meanwhile Trump Mobile is lying about their Chinese manufactured Android phone being made in America. It’s not. This is literally impossible, and anyone who believes the bullshit sales pitch is the definition of a stupid Trump supporter. Oh wait, now I see the genius financial incentive.

Congratulations to [SmartLess Mobile](https://www.smartlessmobile.com) for losing their ’most shitty cellular plan’ crown.
