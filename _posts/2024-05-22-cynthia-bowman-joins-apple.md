Mark Gurman, writing for Bloomberg:

>Apple Inc. hired a new diversity chief for the fourth time in recent years as the iPhone maker seeks to make its workforce more inclusive.
>
>Banking veteran Cynthia Bowman is taking over the role from Barbara Whye, becoming vice president of inclusion and diversity. Bowman left Bank of America Corp. earlier this year after a 17-year career there, serving most recently as chief diversity, inclusion and social responsibility officer.
>
>"We are excited that Cynthia Bowman will serve as Apple's next Vice President of Inclusion and Diversity," an Apple spokesperson said in a statement. "Cynthia is an accomplished leader in her field and is deeply committed to the work we're doing to advance inclusion and diversity at Apple."

It is quite unusual to see such a frequent turnover of vice president positions at Apple. I would love to know what it is about this role that makes finding someone who meshes well with the company culture so difficult.
