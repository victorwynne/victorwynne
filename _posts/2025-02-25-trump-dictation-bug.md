Juli Clover, writing for MacRumors:

>Multiple iPhone owners today noticed a pronunciation processing issue that causes the word “Trump” to momentarily show up when using dictation to send a message with the word “racist.”

>In some cases, when speaking the word racist through the ‌iPhone‌’s built-in dictation feature, the ‌iPhone‌ briefly interprets the spoken word as “Trump” and “Trump” text shows up in the Messages app before being corrected to the actual word (racist) as Apple’s processing interprets what was said.

Is this actually an error though? Seems pretty accurate to me.
