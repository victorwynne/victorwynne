Quoting from [this post](https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/state-of-american-drinking-water.php) by the Environmental Working Group:

>EWG’s latest update to the national Tap Water Database — the most comprehensive resource of its kind — reveals that drinking water across the U.S. contains hundreds of chemicals, heavy metals and radioactive substances. They’re often at levels exceeding what scientists consider safe, even if the water quality meets outdated federal standards.
>
>For over 30 years, EWG has led the charge in advocating for stricter regulation of chemicals and empowering consumers with vital information to reduce exposure to hazardous contaminants in water. But decades later, U.S. drinking water still often fails to meet health-based guidelines and can still pose risks, despite complying with legal limits.
>
>And hard-won, vital drinking water protections are at risk, including landmark limits on the “[forever chemicals](https://www.ewg.org/areas-focus/toxic-chemicals/pfas-chemicals)” known as PFAS in drinking water finalized last year. The state of American drinking water continues to be perilous, and the need for stricter regulation remains.

The [results for my water source](https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/system.php?pws=NY7003493), which serves 8,958,659 New Yorkers, will definitely be keeping me up at night.
