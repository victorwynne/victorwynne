Brian Steinberg, writing for *Variety*:

>MSNBC had planned to keep its name, but NBCU recently decided to retain its famous Peacock design and markings and not share them, requiring Versant to make changes to some of its networks that use those insignia and the NBC logo, Lazarus said. “As we all know, the peacock is synonymous with NBCUniversal, and it is a symbol they have decided to keep within the NBCU family,” he said. “This gives us the opportunity to chart our own path forward, create distinct brand identities, and establish an independent news organization following the spin.”

The peculiar part isn’t the change itself, but rather what they’re keeping: those two letters “MS” that originally stood for Microsoft. The company that invested in the network back in 1996. Microsoft sold its stake years ago, yet here we are in 2025 with a news organization clinging to initials that reference a partnership from the Clinton administration.

It’s like getting divorced but keeping your ex-spouse’s initials on your business cards because, well, people might recognize them. The whole thing feels like a case study in how corporate nostalgia can override common sense, especially when you’re trying to convince viewers you’re charting a bold new path forward. Prepare to watch this fall flat.
