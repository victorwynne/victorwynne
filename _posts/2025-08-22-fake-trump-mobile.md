Dominic Preston, writing for *The Verge*:

>When Trump Mobile first unveiled the [T1 Phone](https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/687492/trump-mobile-phone-t1), we were confused by the mixed marketing, which included dubious renders of what at least *appeared* to be an original phone along with multiple appearances from what was quite clearly a gold-plated iPhone. Now we can add Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Ultra into the mix.

>The Trump Mobile team [shared an ad to X on Wednesday](https://x.com/TrumpMobile/status/1957955640565068159) pushing preorders of the T1, but with an image we’d never seen before. You don’t have to look hard to realize that this is an S25 Ultra that’s been Photoshopped gold with a T1 logo and US flag; looking a little closer confirms that it’s a render of [that phone in a Spigen case](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spigen.com%2Fproducts%2Fgalaxy-s25-series-case-thin-fit&xcust=__vg0822awM__764175__________________), right down to the Spigen logo they didn’t bother to remove.

>It’s a remarkable choice because the S25 Ultra looks even less like the T1 Phone’s official renders than the iPhone the company has [previously used](https://x.com/TrumpMobile/status/1939318604459069440) in promotions. Even Spigen noticed the dupe, saying what we’re all thinking in its [reply on X](https://x.com/spigen/status/1958570471022370864): “??? bro what”.

This just keeps getting better. When exactly do those “[American hands behind every device](https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/693080/trump-mobile-t1-phone-made-usa)” come into play?
