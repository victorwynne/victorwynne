Chris Willman, writing for Variety:

>A video posted by the singer on TikTok shows a Dodgers rep telling her the performance will need to be in English — cutting right to footage of the end of her National Anthem *en espanol*, which appears to be enthusiastically received in the ballpark.
>
>Nezza’s original TikTok post about her Spanish-language rendering, which had more than 4 million views as of Sunday afternoon, was captioned: “Watch the Dodgers tell me I can’t sing the Spanish ‘Star Spangled Banner that Roosevelt literally commissioned in 1945… So I did it anyway.”

More than 40 million people in the United States speak Spanish. We are literally the second largest country of Spanish speakers, only Mexico has more.
