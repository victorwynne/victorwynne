Louie Mantia, commenting on Apple’s fairly confusing implementation of Liquid Glass:

>One reason that developers struggle with implementing Liquid Glass is Apple’s own evolving implementation of it. From just the first few beta releases, enough of it has changed to make it difficult for some developers to understand what exactly Apple’s vision of it is. It also communicates a level of uncertainty about things that haven’t yet been addressed about its various concessions with long-standing UI elements in macOS especially. I do not want to list them all.
>
>When Apple themselves have not yet reasonably prescribed what standard UI elements look like in this new design system, how can any developer responsibly implement them in good conscience? Isn’t there something about this that just reeks? Adopting a standard control means it can change without your involvement. This has always been true to some extent, but the stink of it keeps getting worse as trust in the company’s vision erodes over time, right?

We should see developer beta 4 early next week, along with the first public beta. I am very curious to see what, if anything, has evolved with the design after their recent Liquid->Frosted changes. There are really only seven working weeks left for developers to have their apps ready for the public release. Apple loves being able to feature third party apps on day one, but they are really putting a time crunch on them this year.
