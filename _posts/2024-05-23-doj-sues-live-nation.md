>Live Nation directly manages more than 400 musical artists and, in total, controls around 60% of concert promotions at major concert venues across the country. Live Nation also owns or controls more than 265 concert venues in North America, including more than 60 of the top 100 amphitheaters in the United States. For comparison, its closest rival owns no more than a handful of top amphitheaters. And, of course, through Ticketmaster, Live Nation controls roughly 80% or more of major concert venuesâ€™ primary ticketing for concerts and a growing share of ticket resales in the secondary market.

This could not be more cut and dry. As opposed to the DOJ lawsuit regarding Apple, this is what a monopoly actually looks like.
