>This badge would’ve been (obviously!) made before desktop publishing. A badge template would’ve been printed by a local printing company, then fed into a typewriter to type the individual employee details. And that typed text is suspiciously uniform.

It is always interesting to see the great lengths forgers will go to only to make the silliest of small yet detrimental mistakes. The fact that Apple employee #8 chimed in about it being fake is pure internet gold.
