Jonathan Bell, writing for Wallpaper:

>In a joint statement issued today, Jony Ive and Sam Altman have announced the creation of io, a joint venture that points to the imminent arrival of new computing products designed to take advantage of the true potential of AI.

This is the first time I have actually felt excited about a potential AI hardware device. Whatever the end result, it will damn sure be dripping with the fit and finish Ive always delivered in Apple hardware.
