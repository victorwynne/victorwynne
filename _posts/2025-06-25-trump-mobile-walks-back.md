Quoting myself from [last week](/trump-mobile/):

>Apple is being threatened with huge tariffs for not manufacturing the iPhone in America, meanwhile Trump Mobile is lying about their Chinese manufactured Android phone being made in America. It’s not. This is literally impossible, and anyone who believes the bullshit sales pitch is the definition of a stupid Trump supporter.

Here is David Pierce today, writing for The Verge:

>The T1’s new tagline is "Premium Performance. Proudly American." Its website says the device is "designed with American values in mind" and there are "American hands behind every device." Under Key Features, the first thing listed is "American-Proud Design." None of this indicates, well, anything. It certainly doesn’t say the device is made in the USA, or even designed in the USA. There are just… some hands. In America.
