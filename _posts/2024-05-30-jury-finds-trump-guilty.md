Lauren Feiner, senior policy reporter at The Verge:

>A Manhattan jury found former President Donald Trump guilty on all counts in a case accusing him of [falsifying business records to conceal payments he made](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/13/politics/donald-trump-hush-money-trial-explained/index.html) to suppress unflattering stories about him.
>
>It’s the first time a former president has been convicted of felony charges.
>
>In remarks shortly after the verdict, Trump called it a “disgrace” and said the trial was “rigged.”

The only disgrace here is the man himself. I’m happy about the verdict, but of all the cases against him I feel that this one matters the least to potential voters.
