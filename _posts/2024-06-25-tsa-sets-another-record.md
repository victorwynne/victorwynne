>TSA expects to screen more than 32 million individuals from Thursday, June 27 through Monday, July 8, which is a 5.4% increase over 2023 Independence Day holiday travel volumes. On Sunday, June 23, TSA broke the record for most people screened on a single day, screening nearly 3 million (2.99 million) individuals.

This narrowly beats out the previous record set only [a month ago](https://victorwynne.com/tsa-flight-record/), but the trajectory isn’t surprising. I’m sure Covid cases simultaneously being [on the rise](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2024/06/25/covid-19-cases-rising-america-summer/3011719324520/) is nothing to be concerned about.
