Jeffrey Goldberg, writing for The Atlantic:

>The world found out shortly before 2 p.m. eastern time on March 15 that the United States was bombing Houthi targets across Yemen.
>
>I, however, knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that the attack might be coming. The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.

I’m honestly surprised they weren’t using Telegram. Still easily earned my [idiocy tag](https://victorwynne.com/tags/#idiocy).
