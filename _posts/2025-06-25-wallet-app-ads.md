Joe Rossignol, writing for MacRumors:

>Apple today sent out an ad to some iPhone users in the form of a Wallet app push notification, and not everyone is happy about it.
>
>An unknown number of iPhone users in the U.S. today received the push notification, which promotes a [limited-time Apple Pay discount](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/18/f1-movie-ticket-discounts/) that movie ticket company Fandango is offering on a pair of tickets to [Apple’s new film “F1: The Movie.”](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-f1-movie-second-trailer/)

So many apps are guilty of this same gross behavior, and Apple has never enforced their own rule about marketing push notifications because they are doing the same damn thing.
