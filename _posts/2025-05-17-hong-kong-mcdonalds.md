>Australian studio Landini Associates has given Asia’s busiest restaurant, the Admiralty McDonald’s in Hong Kong, a colourful revamp.

>Landini Associates overhauled the store in downtown Hong Kong, which serves over 1,000 people an hour, to make it more lively and colourful.

>The revamp follows a previous, largely grey renovation of the restaurant by the studio in 2015, which at the time was described as “an experiment in non-design”.

This is a wildly creative take on what an experience at McDonald’s can look like. It has, to my eye, taken the top spot away from [this McDonald’s in Brazil](https://www.dezeen.com/2023/09/26/superlimao-mass-timber-mcdonalds-sao-paulo/).
